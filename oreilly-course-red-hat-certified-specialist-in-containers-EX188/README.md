# [Oreilly - Red Hat Certified Specialist in Containers (EX188)](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/red-hat-certified/9780135335956/)

This directory will be used to follow the lessons and store the files related to the Oreilly Course I am taking to prepare for the RH EX188 exam.

## Firs step is to create your environment using DevBox

Check the DevBox Readme `../devbox.md`

- Note: I am used to using DevBox to bring my tools and configuration anywhere with me. For now, I do not think is needed much for this course. So, I just created a virtual machine using [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) and things are working fine.


## Structure

The course is organized in 10 lessons. For each lesson, I will created a separate `md` file to go through the lectures and demos.
